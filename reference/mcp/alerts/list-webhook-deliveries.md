# List webhook deliveries

<!-- widget:mcp access=read -->

## list_webhook_deliveries

List delivery attempts for a webhook with status and response code (PRO). This answers WHAT, not what to do about it. If you have not already got the method from `docsbook_expert`, get it first: it names which readings answer this question, what to compare them against, and what would make the conclusion wrong. One call, changes nothing.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `webhook_id` | integer | yes | — |
| `limit` | integer | no | Max rows (default 50). |

## Call it

<!-- widget:code-group -->

### MCP

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "list_webhook_deliveries",
    "arguments": {
      "webhook_id": 0
    }
  }
}
```

### curl

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://docsbook.io/api/mcp/server' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer dbk_YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_webhook_deliveries","arguments":{"webhook_id":0}}}'
```

## Try it over REST

The same tool is callable as a plain HTTP request, no MCP client required. It runs on the same server, at the same price.

Your workspace is resolved from the API key, so `workspace_id` is decided server-side here and anything you send for it is ignored.

<!-- widget:api -->

### POST /api/v1/tools/list_webhook_deliveries

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | string | yes | Your API key, sent as `Authorization: Bearer dbk_YOUR_API_KEY`. |
| `args` | object | yes | The arguments above, as one JSON object. |
