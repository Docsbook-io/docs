# List analytics patterns

<!-- widget:mcp access=read price-millicents=4000 -->

## list_analytics_patterns

Catalog of ready-made analytics patterns (visit outcomes, dead-end pages, content health, exit pages, search effectiveness, route patterns, forward/reverse funnels, zero-click search, frustration signals, metric trends, retention, traffic, individual visits) with the plan each needs and the metrics it reports. Call this FIRST when you don't know which analytics tool answers a question, or before composing a chart — it is cheaper than guessing. This answers WHAT, not what to do about it. If you have not already got the method from `docsbook_expert`, get it first: it names which readings answer this question, what to compare them against, and what would make the conclusion wrong. One call, changes nothing.

## Call it

<!-- widget:code-group -->

### MCP

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "list_analytics_patterns",
    "arguments": {}
  }
}
```

### curl

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://docsbook.io/api/mcp/server' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer dbk_YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_analytics_patterns","arguments":{}}}'
```

## Try it over REST

The same tool is callable as a plain HTTP request, no MCP client required. It runs on the same server, at the same price.

Your workspace is resolved from the API key, so `workspace_id` is decided server-side here and anything you send for it is ignored.

<!-- widget:api -->

### POST /api/v1/tools/list_analytics_patterns

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | string | yes | Your API key, sent as `Authorization: Bearer dbk_YOUR_API_KEY`. |
| `args` | object | no | The arguments above, as one JSON object. |

#### Request
