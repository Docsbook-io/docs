# AI Chat

Docsbook ships an AI chatbot trained on the content of your specific documentation. Readers ask a question, the bot searches relevant pages, reads them, and returns a streamed answer with citations.

## How it works

The chat uses a RAG flow built on tool calls. The model decides when to invoke each tool, and the UI shows the live trace of every step.

1. **Search** — the model queries the indexed graph of your docs for relevant sections.
2. **Reading** — it opens specific pages and quotes the text it needs.
3. **Answer** — it composes the response and streams it to the reader via `streamdown`.

Each call is logged so you can later inspect what was asked, what was retrieved, and whether the answer was useful.

## Customization

You control how the bot behaves without writing backend code:

- **Suggested questions** — seed the empty state with 3–5 starter prompts.
- **System prompt** — replace the default instruction set with your own voice and rules.
- **Pre/post-LLM hooks** (PRO) — transform the prompt before the LLM sees it and post-process the response before the reader sees it. See [Chat Hooks](./chat-hooks.md).

## Providers

The default provider is OpenRouter with `openai/gpt-4o-mini`. You can switch to any of:

```yaml
providers:
  - openrouter
  - openai
  - gemini
  - anthropic
```

Bring your own API key from the workspace settings. Costs charged by the upstream provider are billed to your key, not to Docsbook.
