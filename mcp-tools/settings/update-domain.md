# Update domain

<!-- widget:mcp access=write price-millicents=1 -->

## update_domain

Set or remove a custom domain (e.g. docs.yourcompany.com).

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `workspace_id` | string | yes | Numeric workspace id — OR the project as the user names it: 'owner/repo', the repo name alone, the site's display name, its docs URL or custom domain. Text is resolved server-side; an ambiguous name returns the candidates instead of guessing, so pass what the user said rather than calling list_workspaces first. |
| `custom_domain` | string | yes | Custom domain name, or empty string to remove |

### Returns

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | number | — |
| `repoFullName` | string | 'owner/repo', or a Docsbook-hosted placeholder when the site was created from scratch. |
| `customName` | string | null | — |
| `site_url` | string | The live docs URL — report this verbatim, never build one from repoFullName. |
| `customDomain` | string | null | — |
| `plan` | string | free \| pro \| business |
| `visibility` | string | public \| private |
| `not_discoverable` | string | Present ONLY when `visibility` is private, i.e. when no crawler and no answer engine can open this site. Says what that rules out — keyword work, SERP meta, crawler-facing sitemap/llms.txt tuning, backlinks, ranking readings, being cited by ChatGPT or Perplexity — and what is worth the run instead. A private SOURCE REPOSITORY is NOT this and does not rule anything out: Docsbook serves indexed public sites from private repositories. |
| `discoverability_blocked_by` | string | Alongside `not_discoverable`: "private" (the owner's choice) or "plan_locked" (the plan lapsed and Docsbook made it private — tell the owner before doing any work). |
| `aiEnabled` | boolean | — |
| `hasApiKey` | boolean | Whether a REST bearer exists — never the key itself. |
| `hasCustomAiKey` | boolean | — |
| `hasCustomTranslationKey` | boolean | — |
| `hasPassword` | boolean | — |
| `hasSourceOfTruthGraph` | boolean | Whether the semantic index has ever been built. |
| `sso` | object | { configured: false } or { issuer, clientId, allowedDomain, configured: true }. |
| `plan_capabilities` | object | What this plan unlocks. |
| `upgrade_hint` | string | null | — |
| `cta_url` | string | null | The one page readers should end up on. |
| `cta_hint` | string | — |
| `average_product_price_cents` | number | null | — |
| `revenue_hint` | string | — |
| `site_source_url` | string | null | Where facts about the product are read from. |
| `site_source_hint` | string | — |
| `subheaderFolders` | object[] | Top-level folder placements, each carrying the `placement` it resolves to — "subheader_tab" (a tab in the category strip, its pages kept out of the root sidebar tree), "sidebar_tree" (an ordinary folder in the sidebar), "subheader_tab_and_sidebar_tree" (both) or "hidden". Read `placement` rather than re-deriving it from inSubheader / showInSidebar / hiddenInSidebar. |
| `navigation_placement_hint` | string | Present when the project has folder placements: what each one resolves to and why a tab's hiddenInSidebar is not a defect to fix. |
| `publish_mismatch_warning` | string | Present only when the live site does not show what was published. |
| `…` | … | Plus every other project setting on this row — branding colors/fonts, navigation, UI toggles, SEO/GEO/AEO flags, access rules, domain, languages — minus secrets. |
