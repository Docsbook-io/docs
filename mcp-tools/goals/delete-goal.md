# Delete goal

<!-- widget:mcp access=write price-millicents=1 -->

## delete_goal

Archive a goal by name. Archived rather than destroyed, because a funnel step pointing at it would otherwise vanish — and a funnel that silently loses a step reports a BETTER conversion rate than the real one.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `workspace_id` | string | no | Workspace ID (optional when MCP endpoint is auto-scoped). Numeric workspace id — OR the project as the user names it: 'owner/repo', the repo name alone, the site's display name, its docs URL or custom domain. Text is resolved server-side; an ambiguous name returns the candidates instead of guessing, so pass what the user said rather than calling list_workspaces first. |
| `key` | string | yes | The goal's name. |
